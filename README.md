I notice you're asking about repository details, but there appears to be some issues with the URL format and repository name. The URL `https://github.com/Gibthub-sazwanismail/@Copilot.com` is not a valid GitHub repository URL because:

1. GitHub usernames cannot contain:
   - Special characters like '@'
   - Periods within the username
   - The word "GitHub" (or variations) to avoid confusion

2. Repository names cannot contain:
   - Special characters like '@'
   - File extensions like '.com' in this context

Let me help you verify your repository information. Could you please:
1. Confirm your GitHub username (I see "Sazwan1996" in the login information)
2. Provide the correct repository name you'd like to work with

Once you provide the correct repository information, I can help you check its details and status. Would you like me to:
1. Help you create a new repository with a valid name?
2. Check the details of an existing repository?
3. Guide you through the proper naming conventions for GitHub repositories?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
